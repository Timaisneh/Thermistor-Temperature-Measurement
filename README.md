# Thermistor-Temperature-Measurement

Thermistor Temperature Measurement
This project is a temperature measurement tool that uses a thermistor to measure the temperature of its environment. It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple interface and clear instructions.

Getting Started
To use this project, you will need the following equipment:

A development board (e.g. Cypress PSoC 5LP)
A thermistor
A 10k resistor
A breadboard
Jumper wires
A computer with PSoC Creator installed
To get started, follow these steps:

Connect the 10k resistor and thermistor in series on the breadboard.
Connect one end of the series circuit to GND and the other end to VDD.
Connect the junction of the thermistor and resistor to an analog input pin on the development board.
Open the project in PSoC Creator and program the board.
Use the LCD display to view the temperature readings.
Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble using this project, try the following steps:

Check that all connections are correct and secure.
Check that the thermistor and resistor are working properly.
Verify that the correct firmware is installed on the development board.
